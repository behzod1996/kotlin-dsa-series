## Complexity

How well will it scale?

From an architectural perspective, scalability refers to how flexible your app is as your features are increasing. 

From a `database perspective`**, scalability is about the capability of a database to handle an increasing amount of data and users. 

For a **`web server`**, being scalable can mean that it can serve a high number of users accessing it at the same time.

For **`algorithms`**, scalability refers to how the algorithm performs in terms of execution time and memory usage as the input size increases. With a small amount of data, any algorithm may still feel fast. However, as the amount of data increases, an expensive algorithm can become crippling.

The **`Big O notation`** for the different levels of scalability in two dimensions:

- Execution time.
- Memory usage.

### Time complexity

**`Time complexity`** is a measure of the time required to run an algorithm as the input size increases. Instead of measuring actual time required in executing each statement in the code, it considers `how many times each statement executes`.

- Constant time
- Linear time

### Space complexity
